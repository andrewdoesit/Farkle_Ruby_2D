# Farkle Ruby

Welcome to Farkle Ruby! This is a work-in-progress implementation of the classic dice game Farkle, written in Ruby.

I Will be working on this project quite often until its finished then I plan on rewriting it
Possibly just be doing it in Unity after this is done

## Overview

Farkle is a fun and exciting dice game where players roll six dice in order to score points. The game is played with two or more players, and the goal is to reach a predetermined score (usually 10,000 points) before your opponents. Each player takes turns rolling the dice, trying to accumulate points without rolling Farkle (a roll that scores no points and forfeits the player's turn).

## Features

- Rolling and scoring mechanics based on the traditional rules of Farkle.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Integration with the Ruby2D gem for graphics rendering.

## Installation

To run Farkle Ruby, you'll need to have Ruby installed on your machine along with the Ruby2D gem. If you haven't already installed Ruby, you can download it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). Once you have Ruby installed, you can install the Ruby2D gem by running:

```
gem install ruby2d
```
